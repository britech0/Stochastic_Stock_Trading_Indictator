# Stochastic_Stock_Trading_Indictator

Hi

Purpose: To combine multiple indicators into an all in one indicator thereby reducing the number of used indicators
         a user may be able to utilize even more indicators without having to upgrade their membership in TradingView's platform.
         This multi-indicator solution saves money by not needing to make unnecessary upgrades.

Programming Language: PineScript

This is my custom-made TradingView indicator that combines multiple open-source well known indicators like

1. The stochastic indicator (Used as a possible signal to trend changes)
2. Heikin Ashi bar color changer (Helps identify up and down trends in the stock/crypto market)
3. A moving average "cloud" visual (Helps identify continuation of up or down trends)
4. Support and Resistance lines based on fractal theory.


Below you can see the indicator applied to a Weekly-chart of Ethereum. The ideal goal is to buy long when there is a buy signal indicated by 'B' + price being near a support line (lower line) and sell indicated by 'S' + near a resistance line (upper line) :
